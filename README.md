# reactive-programming-notes
This repository includes my learning materials for Reactive Programming using Spring WebFlux. It explains core concepts like event loops, asynchronous streams, reactive data access (R2DBC), and WebFlux APIs. I’m using this to build a strong foundation in non-blocking architecture and reactive microservices.
